## Hi, I'm David, and I'm a Giant Nerd! ðŸ‘‹ #blacklivesmatter 

Staying Safe, Staying Home! ðŸ˜· 

VP of Engineering at [Invitation Homes](https://www.invitationhomes.com/)

I have various homes on the web:

- [@iamagiantnerd](https://twitter.com/iamagiantnerd) on Twitter
- [davidaayers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidaayers/) on LinkedIn
- [iamagiantnerd.com](https://iamagiantnerd.com) - My personal (very anemic) website

I enjoy [speaking](https://github.com/davidaayers/speaker-info), and have done some talks at some great conferences. I'm particularly proud of the talk I did on "[Documenting and Communicating Architectural Decisions](https://github.com/davidaayers/comm-and-doc-arch-decisions)" at [Lead Dev NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwfXkSjFhzc&feature=youtu.be) in 2019.

In the past, I made a game. It sold a couple of copies. I think it's pretty great, YMMV:

- [We Slay Monsters](http://weslaymonsters.com/), available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/332540/We_Slay_Monsters/) and [itch.io](https://furiouslyinactive.itch.io/we-slay-monsters)

I'm a huge video game and board game nerd. Here's my [board game collection](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/iamagiantnerd) on BGG.
