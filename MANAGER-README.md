ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm David (he/him), and this README is intended to give you a brief introduction to what goes on inside my head -- and how we can work together. As you'll learn, one of the things I value _a lot_ is continuous learning & improvement, so this will _always_ be a work in progress. I used to write code, and while I don't anymore, I'm still very interested in technology and architecture, and I try to keep at least a bit of my knowledge intact, so I don't become irrelevant (I've seen it happen to others at my level, and view that as a cautionary tale).

---

## My Role

I lead the Engineering team at Invitation Homes, which consists of software engineers, Salesforce professionals, quality testers, and engineering managers. We work closely with our friends in Product and Delivery to build awesome stuff.

I see my role as:

* **Reducing**: complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity; and
* **Increasing**: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

* Delivering Value
* Provide Context
* Help you grow


## My Assumptions



## What do I value most?

* **Family First**. 

* **Continuous Learning & Improvement**. Most days, I spend 30-60 minutes reading (I use [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) to build a reading list of articles I run across). I also am usually reading at least a couple of books at a time (or listening on Audible). I look at a lot of Pull Requests, mostly so I can learn from what the teams are doing. Building a culture that values Continuous Improvement isn't just something I say because "Agile" -- it's something I practice and want us all to be part of.

* **Information**. It's very hard for me to keep on top of everything. Sharing information with me at the right level is an enormous help. "The right level" is enough information that I am making the right decisions and am prepared to talk about things important / exceptional enough that I'm likely to be asked about it (and probably not much more information than that). I sufficiently value information that I will try to protect confidential information and its sources as much as I can possibly get away with. (REWORD)

* **Pragmatism**. We shouldn't be over-engineering, but neither should we be under-engineering. A great sense of the trade-offs and making the right one for the business is important. (REWORD)

* **Initiative**. At any given time, there are surely a number of things we could be doing to improve. Identifying impactful opportunities for improvement and producing fixes without stepping on toes is one of my favorite qualities in leaders. (REWORD)

* **Curiosity**: keeping an open mind. Seeking to understand why things are the way they are before challenging. Leaning into problems before jumping into "solutioneering". (REWORD)

* **Ownership**: asking yourself, "what can I personally do here?", rather than waiting to be told. Ownership also means seeing things through to the end, both individually and as a team. It's not ok to leave things unfinished; it's totally ok to revisit the team's collective understanding of what finished looks like. (REWORD)

* **Transparency**: In order to succeed as a team, we must share as many details as we can with each other. You should do it in the daily stand-up meeting, in team meetings or in private.
I will share information with you. I expect you to do the same. (REWORD)

## What you can expect of me


## What I expect of you

* Weekly 1:1s with directs
* Regular skip-level 1:1s with grand-directs
* Build a peer network (manager voltron good!)
* Have a good work-life balance, and model that for your team (if you're a manager)
* Be able to change when presented with new information & learning
* Laugh. Humor is important!
* Strong Opinions, Loosely Held
* Take your PTO

## Personality Quirks

Sometimes, I say things as statements that I mean as questions. Sometimes, people think I mean for them to do those things that I say. I'm working on getting better at this, and getting better at asking questions in general.

I really don't like it when people are inattentive in meetings. If you have something more important to do, by all means, please do that thing, and don't waste everyone's time. It has gotten _much_ easier to be inattentive with everyone on Zoom calls, so this takes extra effort. If we're in person, don't be on your laptop, unless you're taking notes.

I'm ADHD, but it usually doesn't interfere with my work. I've mellowed in my old age.

Getting frustrated when we don't pick the "obvious" best choice. One of my failure modes is that if I see the "right" way (in my mind, the most optimal choice), but others aren't seeing it or I'm failing to communicate it well, I'll get frustrated. I've learned to remember that the world is not so black-and-white. Sometimes it doesn't matter if it's the best choice if there is strong buy-in. An imperfect plan well-executed is better than a perfect plan that goes nowhere. (REWORD)
